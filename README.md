##### Abstract
Breast cancer can be considered one of the significant causes of death, especially among women worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to detect and diagnose breast cancer as early as possible to reduce the adverse effects on patients and protect women's health. Breast cancer is the second most prominent cause of mortality in women. Breast cancer detection methods are essential because early detection can lead to more promising treatment results and longer survival rates for patients with the disease. This study proposes a model applying transfer learning and fine-tuning to classify and detect benign, malignant breast cancer, and normal breast. We train the proposed model with transfer learning from the pre-trained MobileNet model to identify breast cancers and optimize the prediction results. The dataset contains 780 ultrasound images categorized into three classes which are benign breast cancer (437 images), malignant breast cancer (210 images), and normal breast (133 images). The experimental results show that applying the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique from the MobileNet model achieves promising results, with the accuracy and F1-score being 0.9651 - 0.9648, 0.9412 - 0.9417, and 0.9060 - 0.9085 respectively with three scenarios.
